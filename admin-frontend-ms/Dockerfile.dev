# Stage 1: Build the React application
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock)
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application source code
COPY . .

# Build the application (Vite typically outputs to /dist)
RUN npm run dev

# Stage 2: Serve the static files with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the built static files from the builder stage to Nginx's web root
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 (Nginx's default port)
EXPOSE 80

# Nginx will start automatically when the container runs
# The default CMD for the nginx image is usually sufficient
