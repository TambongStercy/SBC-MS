# Email Delivery Issues - Fix Guide

## Issues Identified from Your SendGrid Blocks

### 1. Domain Authentication Problem (Main Issue)
```
450 4.1.8 Sender address rejected: Domain not found
```
**Problem**: `em7228.sniperbuisnesscenter.com` domain is not properly authenticated in SendGrid.

### 2. IP Reputation Issue  
```
550 5.7.1 Unfortunately, messages from [159.183.224.105] weren't sent
```
**Problem**: Your sending IP is on Microsoft's blocklist.

## URGENT FIXES NEEDED

### 1. Fix SendGrid Domain Authentication

**Go to SendGrid Dashboard → Settings → Sender Authentication → Authenticate Your Domain**

Add these DNS records to your domain registrar:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: em7228._domainkey.sniperbuisnesscenter.com  
Value: em7228.dkim.sendgrid.net

Type: TXT  
Name: sniperbuisnesscenter.com
Value: v=spf1 include:sendgrid.net ~all
```

### 2. Update Your Environment Variables

In your production `.env` file:
```bash
EMAIL_FROM=Sniper Business Center <noreply@sniperbuisnesscenter.com>
```

### 3. Request IP Change from SendGrid

Contact SendGrid support to:
- Move to a different IP pool
- Request dedicated IP (if on pro plan)
- Check your IP reputation

## Quick Test

After DNS changes (wait 24 hours):
```bash
# Test email delivery
dig TXT sniperbuisnesscenter.com
# Should show SPF record with sendgrid.net
```

## Expected Improvement

- ✅ iCloud emails will be delivered
- ✅ Outlook blocking reduced  
- ✅ Better overall delivery rates
- ❌ Gmail storage issues (user problem, can't fix)

## Code Changes Already Applied

I've updated your email service to use the configured `EMAIL_FROM` instead of hardcoded addresses. This ensures consistency across all emails sent.

**Next Steps:**
1. Complete SendGrid domain authentication
2. Add DNS records  
3. Wait 24-48 hours for propagation
4. Test with problematic email addresses
5. Monitor SendGrid activity feed
