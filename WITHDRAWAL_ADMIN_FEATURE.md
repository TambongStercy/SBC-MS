# Withdrawal Sub-Admin Feature Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a sub-admin system specifically for managing withdrawal requests. This feature allows the main admin to create multiple withdrawal administrators who can help manage withdrawal approvals.

---

## Features Implemented

### Backend Features

1. **New User Role: `WITHDRAWAL_ADMIN`**
   - Added to `UserRole` enum in user-service
   - Sub-admins can only access withdrawal-related features
   - Multiple withdrawal admins can be created

2. **Sub-Admin Management API** (User Service)
   - **POST** `/api/users/sub-admins` - Create new withdrawal admin
   - **GET** `/api/users/sub-admins` - List all withdrawal admins
   - **PUT** `/api/users/sub-admins/:id` - Update sub-admin details
   - **PATCH** `/api/users/sub-admins/:id/block` - Block/unblock sub-admin
   - **DELETE** `/api/users/sub-admins/:id` - Delete sub-admin

3. **Referral Statistics Service** (User Service)
   - Calculates direct and indirect referrals (3 levels deep)
   - Counts referrals with active CLASSIQUE/CIBLE subscriptions
   - **Internal API**: `GET /api/users/internal/:userId/referral-stats`
   - Returns:
     ```json
     {
       "directReferrals": number,
       "indirectReferrals": number,
       "totalReferrals": number,
       "directSubscribedReferrals": number,
       "indirectSubscribedReferrals": number,
       "totalSubscribedReferrals": number
     }
     ```

4. **Enhanced Withdrawal Details** (Payment Service)
   - Withdrawal requests now include:
     - Complete user information
     - Referral statistics (direct/indirect with active subscriptions)
     - User's withdrawal history
     - Current balance across all currencies

## Files Created/Modified

### User Service

#### New Files:
1. **`src/services/referral-stats.service.ts`**
   - Service for calculating referral statistics
   - Traverses 3 levels of referrals
   - Checks for active subscriptions

2. **`src/api/controllers/sub-admin.controller.ts`**
   - Controller for managing withdrawal sub-admins
   - Create, list, update, block, delete operations
   - Only accessible by main ADMIN

3. **`src/api/routes/sub-admin.routes.ts`**
   - Routes for sub-admin management
   - All routes protected with `isAuthenticated` and `isAdmin` middleware

#### Modified Files:
1. **`src/database/models/user.model.ts`**
   ```typescript
   export enum UserRole {
       USER = 'user',
       ADMIN = 'admin',
       WITHDRAWAL_ADMIN = 'withdrawal_admin', // NEW
   }
   ```

2. **`src/api/controllers/user.controller.ts`**
   - Added `getReferralStats()` method for internal service calls

3. **`src/api/routes/user.routes.ts`**
   - Added route: `GET /users/internal/:userId/referral-stats`
   - Added route: `POST/GET/PUT/DELETE /users/sub-admins/*`

### Payment Service

   - Added `ReferralStats` interface
   - Added `getReferralStats(userId)` method
   - Calls user service to get referral statistics

---

## Pending Implementation

### Backend (Still Needed)

1. **Update Withdrawal Approval Controller** (Payment Service)
   ```typescript
   // In getPendingWithdrawals() and getWithdrawalDetails()
   // Need to add:
   - referralStats = await userServiceClient.getReferralStats(userId)
   - withdrawalHistory = await getWithdrawalHistoryForUser(userId)
   ```

2. **Create Withdrawal History Endpoints** (Payment Service)
   - `GET /api/payments/admin/withdrawals/history/:userId` - Get user's withdrawal history
   - `GET /api/payments/admin/withdrawals/validated` - Get all validated withdrawals
   - Need to query Transaction model for past withdrawals

3. **Role-Based Access Control Middleware** (Payment Service)
   ```typescript
   // Allow both ADMIN and WITHDRAWAL_ADMIN to access withdrawal routes
   export const isWithdrawalAdminOrAdmin = (req, res, next) => {
       if (req.user.role === 'admin' || req.user.role === 'withdrawal_admin') {
           next();
       } else {
           res.status(403).json({ message: 'Access denied' });
       }
   };
   ```

4. **Update Auth Middleware** (Gateway/User Service)
   - Ensure WITHDRAWAL_ADMIN can authenticate
   - Return role in JWT token

---

### Frontend (Needed)

1. **Sub-Admin Management Page**
   - Create page at `/sub-admins`
   - List all withdrawal admins
   - Add new withdrawal admin form
   - Edit/block/delete actions
   - Only accessible by main admin

2. **Update Withdrawal Approval Page**
   - Add referral statistics display:
     ```
     Direct Referrals: 10 (5 with active subscriptions)
     Indirect Referrals: 25 (12 with active subscriptions)
     Total Subscribed Referrals: 17
     ```
   - Add withdrawal history section showing past requests
   - Show user's complete profile information

3. **Withdrawal History Page**
   - Dedicated page showing all validated withdrawals
   - Filter by date range, user, amount
   - Export to CSV functionality

4. **Update Sidebar & Authentication**
   - Add conditional rendering based on user role
   - Show only withdrawal-related menu items for WITHDRAWAL_ADMIN
   - Main admin sees everything including sub-admin management

5. **Login Page Updates**
   - Support WITHDRAWAL_ADMIN login
   - Redirect to appropriate dashboard based on role

## API Response Examples

### Get Withdrawal with Enhanced Data

          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "pagination": {...}
  }
}
```

---

## Database Schema

No database changes required - using existing User and Transaction models.

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Sub-Admin Permissions**
   - Can ONLY access withdrawal routes
   - Cannot access user management, settings, other services
   - Cannot create other sub-admins (only main admin can)

2. **Password Security**
   - Passwords hashed with bcrypt
   - Minimum password requirements enforced

3. **Audit Trail**
   - Log all sub-admin actions (approval/rejection)
   - Include sub-admin email in logs

---
