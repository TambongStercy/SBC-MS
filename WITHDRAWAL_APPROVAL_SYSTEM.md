# Withdrawal Approval System Documentation

## Overview

The SBC withdrawal system has been enhanced with an **admin approval layer** to prevent fraud and provide better control over fund disbursements. All user-initiated withdrawals now require admin approval before processing.

## üîê **Security & Authorization**

### **Admin-Only Access**
All withdrawal approval endpoints require:
1. **Authentication**: Valid JWT token
2. **Admin Role**: User must have admin privileges
3. **Rate Limiting**: General rate limiter applied to all routes

### **Middleware Stack**
```typescript
router.use(authenticate);     // Verify JWT token
router.use(requireAdmin);     // Check admin role
router.use(generalLimiter);   // Rate limiting
```

---

## üíæ **Database Changes**

### **New Fields in Transaction Model**

```typescript
interface ITransaction {
  // ... existing fields ...

  // Admin Approval Fields
  approvedBy?: ObjectId;        // Admin who approved
  approvedAt?: Date;            // Approval timestamp
  rejectedBy?: ObjectId;        // Admin who rejected
  rejectedAt?: Date;            // Rejection timestamp
  rejectionReason?: string;     // Reason for rejection
  adminNotes?: string;          // Admin notes/comments
}
```

### **Transaction Status Flow**

```

```

## üìß **Notifications**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Admin Dashboard Integration**

### **Required UI Components**

#### **1. Pending Withdrawals Table**
Display columns:
- Transaction ID
- User Name/Email
- Amount + Currency
- Withdrawal Type (Mobile Money/Crypto)
- Date Requested
- Actions (Approve/Reject/View Details)

#### **2. Withdrawal Details Modal**
Show:
- Full transaction details
- User information
- Account/wallet details
- Transaction history
- Risk indicators
- Approve/Reject buttons with reason input

#### **3. Statistics Dashboard**
Metrics:
- Pending approvals (count)
- Approved today (count)
- Rejected today (count)
- Currently processing (count)
- Average approval time
- Rejection rate

#### **4. Bulk Actions**
- Select multiple withdrawals
- Bulk approve for trusted users
- Filter by amount/type/date
- Search by transaction ID or user

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Business Logic**

### **Approval Process**

When admin approves a withdrawal:
1. Update transaction status to `PROCESSING`
2. Record admin ID and approval timestamp
3. Add admin notes to transaction metadata
4. Determine withdrawal type (mobile money or crypto)
5. Initiate external payout via appropriate gateway:
   - **Mobile Money**: CinetPay or FeexPay
   - **Crypto**: NOWPayments
6. Send approval notification to user
7. Return success response

### **Rejection Process**

When admin rejects a withdrawal:
1. Calculate refund amount (original amount + fee)
2. Refund to user's balance (XAF or USD depending on withdrawal type)
3. Update transaction status to `REJECTED_BY_ADMIN`
4. Record rejection reason and admin details
5. Add rejection metadata to transaction
6. Send rejection notification to user with reason
7. Return success response

### **Balance Handling**

**Important**: User balance is NOT debited during OTP verification anymore. It's only debited when:
- Admin approves the withdrawal, OR
- During approval, balance is checked again before processing

This prevents balance being held up for extended periods while awaiting approval.

## üö® **Error Handling**

### **Common Errors**

| Error | Status | Cause | Solution |
|-------|--------|-------|----------|
| `Transaction not found` | 404 | Invalid transaction ID | Verify transaction ID |
| `Cannot approve withdrawal with status: X` | 400 | Wrong status | Only `PENDING_ADMIN_APPROVAL` can be approved |
| `Rejection reason is required` | 400 | Missing required field | Provide rejection reason |
| `Admin not authenticated` | 401 | Missing/invalid token | Re-authenticate |
| `Insufficient balance` | 400 | User spent funds while waiting | Cancel/reject withdrawal |

---

## üìà **Monitoring & Analytics**

### **Key Metrics to Track**

1. **Approval Rate**: `(Approved / Total) * 100`
2. **Average Approval Time**: Time from `PENDING_ADMIN_APPROVAL` to `PROCESSING`
3. **Rejection Reasons**: Group by reason to identify patterns
4. **Peak Withdrawal Times**: Identify when most withdrawals occur
5. **Admin Performance**: Track which admins approve/reject and response times

### **Logging**

All actions are logged:
```
[INFO] Admin {adminId} approving withdrawal {transactionId}
[INFO] Withdrawal {transactionId} approved by admin {adminId} and processing initiated
[INFO] Admin {adminId} rejecting withdrawal {transactionId}: {reason}
[INFO] Withdrawal {transactionId} rejected by admin {adminId}. {amount} refunded to user {userId}
```

## üîÑ **Migration Guide**

### **For Existing Deployments**

1. **Database Migration** (automatic via Mongoose):
   - New fields will be added automatically
   - Existing transactions unaffected
   - No manual migration needed

2. **Pending Withdrawals**:
   - Any withdrawals in `PENDING` status before deployment will continue processing automatically
   - Only NEW withdrawals after deployment will require admin approval

3. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Deploy new admin UI components
   - Train admins on new approval workflow
   - Set up monitoring dashboards

---

## üß™ **Testing**

### **Test Scenarios**

#### **1. Normal Flow**
```
1. User initiates withdrawal
2. User verifies OTP
3. Check status = PENDING_ADMIN_APPROVAL
4. Admin approves
5. Check status = PROCESSING
6. Verify external payout initiated
7. User receives notification
```

#### **2. Rejection Flow**
```
1. User initiates withdrawal
2. User verifies OTP
3. Admin rejects with reason
4. Check status = REJECTED_BY_ADMIN
5. Verify balance refunded
6. User receives rejection notification
```

#### **3. Bulk Approval**
```
1. Create 5 pending withdrawals
2. Admin bulk approves all 5
3. Verify all 5 move to PROCESSING
4. Check all users notified
```

### **Test Endpoints**

```bash
# Get pending withdrawals
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3003/api/admin/withdrawals/pending" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"

# Approve withdrawal
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3003/api/admin/withdrawals/TXN_123/approve" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"adminNotes": "Approved"}'

# Reject withdrawal
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3003/api/admin/withdrawals/TXN_123/reject" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rejectionReason": "Fraud suspected", "adminNotes": "Multiple requests"}'
```
