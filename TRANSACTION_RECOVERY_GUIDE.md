# üîÑ Transaction Recovery System Guide

This guide explains how to recover your lost transactions from August 15th onwards using the newly implemented recovery system.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Start Your Services
```bash
# Start all services with Docker
docker-compose up

# Or start individual services
docker-compose up payment-service user-service
```

### 2. Recovery Options

You have **3 ways** to recover transactions:

#### **Option A: CLI Script (Recommended for Bulk Recovery)**
```bash
cd payment-service

# Recover CinetPay withdrawals/payouts
npm run recovery recover --provider cinetpay --type payout --references "ref1,ref2,ref3"

# Recover FeexPay withdrawals/payouts  
npm run recovery recover --provider feexpay --type payout --references "ref1,ref2,ref3"

# Recover CinetPay payments/subscriptions
npm run recovery recover --provider cinetpay --type payment --references "trans_id1,trans_id2"

# Recover FeexPay payments/subscriptions
npm run recovery recover --provider feexpay --type payment --references "ref1,ref2,ref3"
```

#### **Option B: Admin API Endpoints**
```bash
# Run manual recovery via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/recovery/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "provider": "cinetpay",
    "transactionType": "payout", 
    "references": ["ref1", "ref2", "ref3"]
  }'
```

#### **Option C: Admin Dashboard**
- Access your admin dashboard
- Navigate to Recovery section
- Upload transaction references
- Monitor recovery progress

## üìã What You Need to Provide

### **For CinetPay:**
- **Withdrawals**: Use the `client_transaction_id` (your internal reference)
- **Payments**: Use the `cpm_trans_id` from CinetPay webhook/response

### **For FeexPay:**
- **Withdrawals**: Use the `reference` from FeexPay API response
- **Payments**: Use the transaction `reference` from FeexPay

## üîç How It Works

### **Automatic Recovery (During User Registration):**
1. When a user registers with email/phone matching a lost transaction
2. System automatically restores all their transactions
3. Updates balances and activates subscriptions
4. Marks transactions as "restored"

### **Manual Recovery:**
1. Fetches transaction details from provider APIs
2. If user exists ‚Üí immediately restores transaction
3. If user doesn't exist ‚Üí saves to recovery collection for later
4. When user registers ‚Üí automatically processes saved transactions

## üìä Monitoring & Statistics

```bash
# Check recovery statistics
npm run recovery stats

# Or via API
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/recovery/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Recovery Commands

```bash
cd payment-service

# Example: Recover specific CinetPay payouts
npm run recovery recover \
  --provider cinetpay \
  --type payout \
  --references "SBC_WITHDRAW_001,SBC_WITHDRAW_002,SBC_WITHDRAW_003"

# Example: Recover FeexPay payments
npm run recovery recover \
  --provider feexpay \
  --type payment \
  --references "FX_PAY_001,FX_PAY_002"

# Example: Process specific user registration manually
npm run recovery process-user-registration \
  --userId "USER_ID_HERE" \
  --email "user@example.com" \
  --phone "+237612345678"
```

## ‚úÖ What to Do Now

### **Step 1: Gather Your Transaction References**
- **CinetPay Payouts**: Collect all `client_transaction_id` values from Aug 15 onwards
- **FeexPay Payouts**: Collect all `reference` values from Aug 15 onwards
- **Payment Transactions**: Collect transaction IDs from both providers

### **Step 2: Run Initial Recovery**
```bash
# Start with a small batch first (test)
npm run recovery recover --provider cinetpay --type payout --references "test_ref_1,test_ref_2"

# Then run your full batch
npm run recovery recover --provider cinetpay --type payout --references "ref1,ref2,ref3,..." 
```

### **Step 3: Monitor Results**
```bash
# Check statistics
npm run recovery stats

# Check what was saved for later recovery
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/recovery/records \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

### **Step 4: User Registration Testing**
- Test user registration with emails/phones from lost transactions
- Verify transactions are automatically restored
- Check user balances are updated correctly

## üîß Important Notes

1. **Provider API Status**: The recovery script includes placeholder methods for CinetPay/FeexPay payment status checks. You'll need to implement the actual API calls based on your provider documentation.

2. **Successful Transactions Only**: Only transactions marked as "successful" by providers will be recovered.

3. **No Duplicate Processing**: The system prevents processing the same transaction multiple times.

4. **Safe Registration**: User registration won't fail if recovery fails - it will just log the error.

5. **Balance Updates**: Recovered withdrawals will deduct from user balances, payments will activate subscriptions.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**
- **"Transaction not found"**: Check if the reference ID is correct
- **"User not found"**: Transaction will be saved for recovery when user registers
- **"Provider API error"**: Verify provider credentials and API endpoints

### **Logs Location:**
Check payment-service logs for detailed recovery information.

### **Recovery Status:**
- `not_restored`: Waiting for user to register
- `restored`: Successfully recovered and processed

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify your transaction references are correct
3. Test with a small batch first
4. Use the statistics endpoint to monitor progress

The system is now ready to recover your lost transactions! üéâ
