# Crypto Pricing Implementation for SBC Subscriptions

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of crypto-specific pricing for SBC subscription plans using NOWPayments integration. The system now supports dual pricing structures:
- **Traditional payments** (Mobile Money): XAF pricing
- **Crypto payments** (NOWPayments): USD pricing

## Pricing Structure

### Current Implementation Status: âœ… COMPLETED

#### Traditional Payments (XAF)
- **Classique**: 2,070 XAF (~$3.40 USD)
- **CiblÃ©**: 5,140 XAF (~$8.40 USD)  
- **Upgrade**: 3,070 XAF (~$5.00 USD)

#### Crypto Payments (USD) - NEW
- **Classique**: $4 USD (excluding fees)
- **CiblÃ©s**: $10 USD (excluding fees)
- **Upgrade**: $6 USD (excluding fees)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Subscription Service Updates âœ…
**File**: `user-service/src/services/subscription.service.ts`

- Added `AVAILABLE_PLANS_CRYPTO_USD` array with USD pricing
- Updated `getAvailablePlans()` method to accept `paymentMethod` parameter
- Modified `initiateSubscriptionPurchase()` to handle crypto vs traditional pricing
- Updated `initiateSubscriptionUpgrade()` with crypto-specific upgrade pricing ($6 USD)

### 2. Crypto Pricing Configuration âœ…
**File**: `payment-service/src/config/crypto-pricing.ts`

- Defined `CRYPTO_SUBSCRIPTION_PRICING` with exact USD amounts
- Implemented currency conversion utilities
- Added commission structure for crypto payments

### 3. Payment Method Detection
The system detects crypto payments through:
- Payment method parameter in API calls
- NOWPayments session identification
- Metadata in payment confirmations

### 4. Commission Structure for Crypto Payments
**Crypto Commission Rates** (converted to XAF for internal processing):
- **Classique**: $4 Ã— 660 = 2,640 XAF base
- **CiblÃ©**: $10 Ã— 660 = 6,600 XAF base  
- **Upgrade**: $6 Ã— 660 = 3,960 XAF base

**Commission Distribution**:
- Level 1: 50% of base
- Level 2: 25% of base
- Level 3: 12.5% of base

## API Usage

### Initiating Crypto Subscription Purchase
```javascript
// For crypto payments
const result = await subscriptionService.initiateSubscriptionPurchase(
    userId, 
    SubscriptionType.CLASSIQUE, 
    'crypto'
);

// For traditional payments (default)
const result = await subscriptionService.initiateSubscriptionPurchase(
    userId, 
    SubscriptionType.CLASSIQUE, 
    'traditional'
);
```

### Getting Available Plans
```javascript
// Get crypto pricing
const cryptoPlans = subscriptionService.getAvailablePlans('crypto');

// Get traditional pricing
const traditionalPlans = subscriptionService.getAvailablePlans('traditional');
```

## Currency Conversion
The system uses different conversion rates:
- **Deposits/Payments**: 1 USD = 660 XAF
- **User Withdrawals**: 1 USD = 590 XAF (better rate for users)

## Testing Checklist

### âœ… Completed Features
- [x] Dual pricing structure implementation
- [x] Payment method detection
- [x] Crypto-specific upgrade pricing
- [x] Commission calculation for crypto payments
- [x] Currency conversion utilities
- [x] API parameter handling

### ðŸ”„ Integration Points
- [ ] Frontend integration to pass `paymentMethod` parameter
- [ ] NOWPayments webhook handling for crypto payment confirmations
- [ ] Admin dashboard updates to show crypto vs traditional pricing
- [ ] Testing with actual NOWPayments transactions

## Error Handling
The system handles:
- Invalid payment method parameters
- Missing crypto pricing configuration
- Currency conversion errors
- Commission calculation failures

## Security Considerations
- All crypto amounts are validated before processing
- Currency conversion rates are configurable
- Commission calculations are logged for audit trails
- Payment method validation prevents pricing manipulation

## Next Steps
1. **Frontend Updates**: Update subscription purchase UI to include payment method selection
2. **Webhook Integration**: Ensure NOWPayments webhooks properly identify crypto payments
3. **Testing**: Conduct end-to-end testing with actual crypto transactions
4. **Monitoring**: Add metrics for crypto vs traditional payment adoption

## Configuration Files
- `user-service/src/services/subscription.service.ts` - Main subscription logic
- `payment-service/src/config/crypto-pricing.ts` - Crypto pricing configuration
- Payment service integration for NOWPayments handling

# Recent Bug Fixes

### NOWPayments Webhook Payment ID Mismatch Fix âœ…
**Issue**: Payment ID comparison was failing due to type mismatch (string vs number)
**Fix**: Updated payment ID comparisons to use `String()` conversion for consistent comparison
**Files Updated**: 
- `payment-service/src/services/payment.service.ts` - Fixed NOWPayments and CinetPay payment ID comparisons

### Controller Integration Status âœ…
Both subscription endpoints now properly handle the `paymentMethod` parameter:

#### Purchase Endpoint
```
POST /api/subscriptions/purchase
Body: {
  "planType": "CLASSIQUE" | "CIBLE",
  "paymentMethod": "crypto" | "traditional" (optional, defaults to "traditional")
}
```

#### Upgrade Endpoint  
```
POST /api/subscriptions/upgrade
Body: {
  "paymentMethod": "crypto" | "traditional" (optional, defaults to "traditional")
}
```

## Implementation Status Summary

### âœ… COMPLETED FEATURES
- [x] Dual pricing structure (XAF for traditional, USD for crypto)
- [x] Payment method detection and routing
- [x] Crypto-specific commission calculations
- [x] Currency conversion utilities
- [x] API endpoints with payment method parameter support
- [x] Webhook payment ID mismatch bug fix

### ðŸ”„ READY FOR TESTING
The crypto pricing implementation is now complete and ready for end-to-end testing:

1. **Frontend Integration**: Frontend can now pass `paymentMethod: "crypto"` in subscription purchase/upgrade requests
2. **NOWPayments Integration**: Webhooks should now process correctly without payment ID mismatch errors
3. **Commission Distribution**: Crypto payments will use correct USD-based commission calculations
4. **Currency Handling**: Proper conversion between USD and XAF for internal processing

### ðŸ“‹ TESTING CHECKLIST
- [ ] Test crypto subscription purchase with `paymentMethod: "crypto"`

## Production Deployment Notes
- Ensure NOWPayments API keys and webhook secrets are properly configured
- Monitor webhook processing logs for any remaining type conversion issues
- Verify commission distribution amounts match expected USD/XAF conversions
- Test with small amounts first before full deployment
