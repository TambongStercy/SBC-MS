## ❓ Common Questions

### Q: Why am I not getting WhatsApp messages but SMS works?
**A:** WhatsApp and SMS are different systems. WhatsApp needs internet and specific app settings, while SMS works through your mobile carrier.

### Q: I see the message ID in logs but don't receive anything?
**A:** This means our system sent the message successfully, but something on your device is blocking it. Follow the steps above.

### Q: Can I get codes via email instead?
**A:** Yes! When requesting a verification code, choose "Email" instead of "WhatsApp" if the option is available.

### Q: The messages come very late (hours later)?
**A:** This usually means WhatsApp notifications are set to "Low Priority". Change to "High Priority" in notification settings.

### Q: I only receive some codes but not others?
**A:** This suggests sporadic notification issues. Try the "Restart WhatsApp" step whenever you don't receive a code.

## ✅ Prevention Tips

1. **Keep WhatsApp updated** to the latest version
2. **Maintain good internet connection** when requesting codes
3. **Don't block** or mute business numbers
