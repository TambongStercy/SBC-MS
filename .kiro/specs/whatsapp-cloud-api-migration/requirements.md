# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the WhatsApp messaging functionality from Bailey (WhatsApp Web scraping) to the official WhatsApp Cloud API. This migration will provide better reliability, official support, reduced maintenance overhead, and compliance with WhatsApp's terms of service. The migration should maintain all existing functionality while improving system stability and scalability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to use the official WhatsApp Cloud API instead of Bailey, so that I have a more reliable and officially supported messaging solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system sends a WhatsApp message THEN it SHALL use the WhatsApp Cloud API instead of Bailey
2. WHEN the WhatsApp Cloud API is configured THEN the system SHALL authenticate using official API credentials
3. WHEN Bailey is replaced THEN the system SHALL no longer depend on web scraping or unofficial methods
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all Bailey-related code and dependencies SHALL be removed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to continue receiving WhatsApp notifications seamlessly, so that the migration doesn't disrupt my experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification is triggered THEN the system SHALL send WhatsApp messages with the same content and format as before
2. WHEN the system sends OTP codes THEN they SHALL be delivered via WhatsApp Cloud API with identical formatting
3. WHEN users receive messages THEN the sender information SHALL remain consistent
4. WHEN the migration occurs THEN existing message templates SHALL continue to work without modification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging for the WhatsApp Cloud API, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot messaging issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the WhatsApp Cloud API returns an error THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN messages fail to send THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to administrators
4. WHEN the API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle downtime and queue messages for retry

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure WhatsApp Cloud API credentials securely, so that API access is properly managed and secured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the API THEN credentials SHALL be stored in environment variables
2. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate WhatsApp Cloud API credentials before accepting requests
3. WHEN credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages during startup
4. WHEN API tokens expire THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh automatically if supported

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want webhook support for message status updates, so that I can track delivery status and handle failed messages appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is sent THEN the system SHALL register for delivery status webhooks
2. WHEN WhatsApp delivers a message THEN the webhook SHALL update the message status in the database
3. WHEN a message fails to deliver THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason and trigger appropriate fallback actions
4. WHEN webhook endpoints are called THEN they SHALL validate the request signature for security

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the migration to be backward compatible, so that existing integrations and API contracts remain functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external services call notification endpoints THEN the API interface SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN the WhatsApp service is called internally THEN existing method signatures SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN configuration is updated THEN existing environment variable names SHALL be maintained where possible
4. WHEN the migration is deployed THEN no breaking changes SHALL be introduced to dependent services
