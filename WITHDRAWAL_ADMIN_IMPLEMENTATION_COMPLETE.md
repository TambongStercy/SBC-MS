# Withdrawal Sub-Admin Feature - Implementation Complete

## ✅ Backend Implementation - COMPLETE

### User Service
1. ✅ **Added WITHDRAWAL_ADMIN Role**
   - Updated `UserRole` enum in `user.model.ts`
   - Role: `withdrawal_admin`

2. ✅ **Sub-Admin Management API**
   - **POST** `/api/users/sub-admins` - Create withdrawal admin
   - **GET** `/api/users/sub-admins` - List all withdrawal admins (paginated)
   - **PUT** `/api/users/sub-admins/:id` - Update sub-admin details
   - **PATCH** `/api/users/sub-admins/:id/block` - Block/unblock sub-admin
   - **DELETE** `/api/users/sub-admins/:id` - Delete sub-admin

3. ✅ **Referral Statistics Service**
   - **Internal API**: `GET /api/users/internal/:userId/referral-stats`
   - Calculates direct (Level 1) and indirect (Level 2 + 3) referrals
   - Counts only referrals with active CLASSIQUE/CIBLE subscriptions
   - Returns comprehensive stats with subscription breakdown

### Payment Service
1. ✅ **Enhanced Withdrawal Approval API**
   - Now includes referral statistics in all withdrawal responses
   - Shows user's withdrawal history (last 5-10 past withdrawals)
   - Complete user profile information (balance, email, phone)

2. ✅ **New Withdrawal History Endpoints**
   - **GET** `/api/payments/admin/withdrawals/history/:userId` - User-specific withdrawal history
   - **GET** `/api/payments/admin/withdrawals/validated` - All validated withdrawals (completed/rejected)
   - Both endpoints support pagination and status filtering

3. ✅ **Role-Based Access Control**
   - New middleware: `requireWithdrawalAccess`
   - Allows both `admin` and `withdrawal_admin` roles
   - Applied to all withdrawal routes
   - Main admin can still manage sub-admins (protected by `requireAdmin`)

### Build Status
- ✅ User Service: Builds successfully
- ✅ Payment Service: Builds successfully
