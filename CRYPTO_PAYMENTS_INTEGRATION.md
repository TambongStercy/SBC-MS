# Crypto Payments Integration for SBC

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of cryptocurrency payments and USD balance functionality for the SBC (Sniper Business Center) platform.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. USD Balance System
- Added `usdBalance` field to User model

- Added currency conversion functionality (XAF â†” USD)
- Conversion rates:
  - XAF to USD: 1 USD = 660 XAF (for deposits/payments)
  - USD to XAF: 1 USD = 590 XAF (for withdrawals - better rate for users)

### 2. Crypto Pricing Structure
All crypto payments are processed in USD with the following pricing:

#### CLASSIQUE Subscription
- Inscription: $4 USD
- Level 1 Commission: $2 USD

- Supported cryptocurrencies

## Testing
- Test crypto payments with small amounts first
- Verify commission distribution in USD
- Test currency conversion functionality
- Validate webhook processing
- Check balance updates are atomic

## Deployment Notes
1. Run USD balance migration before deploying
2. Ensure NOWPayments API credentials are configured
3. Update frontend assets (CSS, JS)
4. Test crypto payment flow in staging environment
5. Monitor crypto payment webhooks after deployment

## Support
